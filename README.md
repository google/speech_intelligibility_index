# Speech Intelligibility Index Matlab implementation
A Python implementation of American National Standard ANSI S3.5-1997 **"Methods for Calculation of the Speech Intelligibility Index"**

This code is translated from Hannes Muesch's Matlab implementation.

To use these scripts successfully, you must be familiar with the concepts and definitions of the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII). You can obtain a copy of the standard at the ANSI webstore https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asa/ansiasas31997r2017

You can reach out to the members of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) Working Group S3-79, which is in charge of reviewing that standard, at https://sii.to/index.html
