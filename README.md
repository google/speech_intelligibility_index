# Speech Intelligibility Index Matlab implementation
A Python implementation of American National Standard ANSI S3.5-1997 **"Methods for Calculation of the Speech Intelligibility Index"**

This code is translated from Hannes Muesch's Matlab implementation.

There is a Google Colab that demonstrates how to use the toolbox and shows some
typical results.  This colab is a good place to start: [Colab Link]
(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bAnDpUUx5-BYkL3l3ukNVVnsLzEhy-ds).

To use these scripts successfully, you must be familiar with the concepts and definitions of the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII). You can obtain a copy of the standard at the ANSI webstore https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asa/ansiasas31997r2017

You can reach out to the members of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) Working Group S3-79, which is in charge of reviewing that standard, at https://sii.to/index.html
